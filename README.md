# Odin Where's Waldo

- This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app), the main goal of this project is to practice using Express and ReactJS to create a simple fullstack app.

- Here is the link to the demo app: [Demo](https://odin-where-is-waldo-eight.vercel.app/). This will takes a few seconds to turn on since I use free plan of Render.

Thank you for visiting my project, hope you have a good day!
